# Electronic Voting System using LPC2148 Microcontroller

This project implements an electronic voting system using an LPC2148 microcontroller. Candidates are displayed on an LCD screen, and voters can cast their votes using push buttons. The system counts the votes and declares the winner.

## Overview

The electronic voting system utilizes the LPC2148 microcontroller to facilitate voting processes. It features a user-friendly interface displayed on an LCD screen, allowing voters to select their preferred candidates with push buttons. The system tallies the votes and announces the winner based on the highest number of votes received.

## Functionality

- **LCD Display**: Candidates and voting information are displayed on the LCD screen, providing clear instructions to voters.
- **Push Button Voting**: Voters can select their preferred candidates using push buttons connected to the microcontroller.
- **Vote Counting**: The microcontroller tallies the votes in real-time and stores the results.
- **Winner Declaration**: Upon completion of the voting process, the system determines the candidate with the highest number of votes and declares them the winner.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Connect the LPC2148 microcontroller, LCD display, and push buttons as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Programming**: Upload the provided code to the microcontroller using appropriate software (e.g., Keil uVision).
3. **Operation**: Power on the system and follow the instructions displayed on the LCD screen to cast votes.
4. **Result**: After all votes are cast, the system announces the winner based on the vote count.
